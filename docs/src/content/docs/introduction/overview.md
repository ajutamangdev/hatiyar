## What is pysecfw?

**pysecfw** is a modular Python security toolkit designed for penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and security research. Built for security professionals, it provides a comprehensive set of tools with an interactive shell, production-ready exploit modules, enumeration capabilities, and a modern CLI.

Think of it as a focused, extensible alternative to larger frameworks - designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to customize.


It provides :
- **Interactive CLI (REPL)** for exploring and executing security modules
- **CVE Exploit Modules** for testing known vulnerabilities
- **Enumeration Tools** for cloud, network and system reconnaissance
- **Cloud Compliance Auditing** (coming soon) via web dashboard
- **Modular plugin architecture** for easy extension

> **Future roadmap:** Additional CVE modules, enhanced security tools, web UI, automation APIs, and integration capabilities
